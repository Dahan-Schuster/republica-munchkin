A level counter for Star Munchkin

Me and my friends love to play Star Munchkin together, but the official Munchkin Level Counter app doesn't really fits us, so here I am.

I'm also doing this to learn more about React Native's (and it's libraries) new features.

## Features

- A better gender system! We did some research on how to be more inclusive with genders in the game, for currently it only supports male and female. Read this greate article: [A Case for Creating Better Gender Rules in Munchkin](https://psiloveyou.xyz/a-case-for-creating-better-gender-rules-for-munchkin-b535b0169e56)
- Fully Sci-Fi UI! Okay, okay, the official app *does* have a Star Munchkin theme, but does it really look like it was made for the stars? Nah, we can do better.
- Customizable features! For me and my friends, of course. If you do have some new awesome feature, please make a pull request or send me an email :)
